## Docker Dev Container

To run `./devContainer.sh` make sure you are the top level directory and run it with `scripts/devContainer.sh`

This will mount the current working directory into a Docker container running Ubuntu, compiling and running should be done through this container to ensure a consistent environment.

[!NOTE] Make Sure Docker Destop is running before trying to run this script
